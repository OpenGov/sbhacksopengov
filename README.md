# SB Hacks, OpenGov API

# Challenge
OpenGov is looking for innovative data enthusiasts. We'll provide you with accurate, up-to-date financial data from our governments. You provide the innovation. We'd love to see folks try and tackle city-wide benchmarking, new ways of visualizing data, or new ways of structuring data to make it easy to search across these data sets. The top team will be something visually striking or powerful.

# Prizes
- Pebble smart watches
- Tickets to our hackathon after party in the hills of Santa Barbara!

# Ideas

- Compare city spendings and rank them
- Visualize how data flows through a city
- Visualize a city's structure (like an org chart)
